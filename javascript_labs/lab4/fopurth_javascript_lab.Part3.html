        <h1>The Lab #4 code Exercise has a problem. If you enter words that start with the first letter of your name
            and they are the same length the program will add them to the timesFound array. I have fixed that bug and used while loops instead of the for loops. The name to search for value is now entered in along with the text to search through.
            Alerts are no longer used. All returned data is written to the page using innerHTML and a counter of timesFound array
            and the array are returned if the name was found. Else the msg Name not found is returned.

        <input id = "userName" type="text"/><br/>
